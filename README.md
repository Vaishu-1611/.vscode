This repository contains various C language codes that I wrote while learning the language.
It includes implementations of basic concepts, data structures, algorithms, and small projects that helped me practice and improve my C programming skills.

📌 About

Written in C language (compiled using gcc).

Covers beginner to intermediate concepts.

Each file focuses on a specific topic or problem.

Aimed at practicing and understanding programming logic.
